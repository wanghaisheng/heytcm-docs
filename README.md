# OpenMarch Website

Here is our main website, and documentation!

## Docs

We use Starlight inside our Astro website for docs.

To edit our docs (or "guides"), go to `src/content/docs/guides`, they are all in markdown, and learn more about the Starlight components [here](https://starlight.astro.build/components/using-components/).
