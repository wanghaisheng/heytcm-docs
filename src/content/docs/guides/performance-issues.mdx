There are a handful of open bugs that cause lag and performance issues.
Follow these guides to address and fix them.

## Horrible lag

If you're experiencing the following, Follow these steps:

- Every interaction takes 3-5 seconds (or more)
- The app is slow to respond to any input
- The app appears to load on startup but does not respond to any input
- Restarting the app or your computer does not fix the issue

This is a bug that has haunted me since June of 2023.
I have yet to find the root cause of it, but I have found a way to temporarily fix it.
If you're curious, check out [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/HeyTCM/HeyTCM/issues/174) for its history and any updated information.

### Steps to fix

<Steps>

1. Close the app
1. Make a backup of your most recent `.dots` file so you don't lose your progress
1. Delete HeyTCM's metadata folder
   - Windows: `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Roaming\HeyTCM`
   - macOS: `/Users/{username}/Library/Application Support/HeyTCM`
   - Linux: I'm not sure, please email me if you know ðŸ™ƒ
1. Open the app
   - Beware of light mode if you had dark mode enabled

</Steps>

This should remove the horrible lag.
In the future I hope to find the root cause and fix it.
