Welcome to OpenMarch! Make sure to [download](/download) and install the app if you haven't already.

## Setting up your project

<Steps>

1. Create a new file. On the launch page, click "Create New", and make a new `.dots` file.

2. Now start off by adding some marchers. Open the marchers sidebar by clicking the "Marchers" button in the topbar. Then click "Add" and fill in your marcher info, for quantity and section. Then create the marchers. Repeat this step for multiple sections if you want.

3. If you have music you would like to write on top of, follow this step. If you don't and are just checking the app out, skip this step.

    Make sure you have a MusicXML and audio file on hand. In a notation software like MuseScore, you should be able to export both.

    Now go into the music modal by clicking "Music" in the topbar. Start by importing the MusicXML file by clicking "Import MusicXML"

    :::note
    There might be issues getting your tempo to line up. Make sure to avoid acceelerandos and ritardandos.

    Then import your audio file by clicking the empty "Audio File" box at the bottom, and import your file. You may have to refresh the app `Ctrl/Cmd+R` for your audio file to appear. Once it does, make sure it's selected.

4. Now, start adding pages by going into the "Pages" sidebar. Click "add" and fill in the quantity. You don't have to fill in the counts and subset right now, you can actually edit the counts and subset in the sidebar when a page is selected.

5. If you'd like to change the field type, go into the "Field" sidebar. We have support for Highschool, College, Pro, and different indoor fields as of 0.0.5.

## Writing drill

You're ready to write some drill now! Here's an overview on the tools.

### Alignment

You can select different marchers that are on different points on the field, and press the different alignment buttons to make really basic lines.

![Alignment buttons in the topbar](/docs/guides/alignment.png)

### Lines

With multiple marchers selected, you can make lines way easier by clicking "Create line", then choosing 2 points and clicking "Apply coordinates".

### Shapes

This is the most exciting drill writing feature right now. With multiple marchers selected, and after drawing a line, click "Create shape". A shape is a group of multiple marchers on top of a line (SVG) path. You can copy the shape to the prev/next page, or ungroup it.

You can add multiple segments, and make curved shapes. Each segment has multiple handles, which you can move. Right now, the segment types are `Line`, `Single Curve`, and `Double curve`. When you have multiple segments, there is also `Move` and `Close`.

`Move` will move the next point to somewhere else, making a gap in the line. `Close` will close the shape, going back to the first segment, useful for making rectangles.
