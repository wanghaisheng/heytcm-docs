What's changed?
- Modals for adding/editing marchers and pages
- Creating marcher/pages in bulk
- Page subsets
- Removal of Ruby on Rails
- Electron integration
- Development onboarding simplification (only need to run npm i once)

December was ALL about transitioning into Electron. OpenMarch no longer needs to run in a browser to work and is fully functional in an Electron instance. Rails has been completely removed in favor of SQLite 3 directly in Electron. The hope is that this will make file system operations (saving, opening) and undo/redo much simpler to implement. Every bit of Rails API has been transposed into SQLite3 directly in Electron. January will be all about finalizing file system integration and adding some creature comforts.

Nice to haves -
- Animation???
- Show marchers from prev page
- Show pathways to prev page
