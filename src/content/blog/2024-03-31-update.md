### What's changed?

March was all about putting in the groundwork for making future feature implementation easier. As new features and classes are built, I'm doing my best to test as I go. My goal has been to be much more class-based, and that has been working out really well.

#### New UI Features

- More mature animation
  - Stopping the animation is not glitchy.
- Pathways to the previous/next dot.
  - These can be toggled on and off

#### Development Improvements

- All actions/keyboard shortcuts are stored in one place
  - Maybe this is a bad thing to do? But, this will make searching for actions easy (like you can do in VSCode)
  - Creating new actions and keyboard shortcuts is very easy
- Field Properties are now more generalized
  - `xCheckpoints` rather than `yard lines`, `yCheckpoints` rather than `hashes`
  - This is planning ahead for supporting more than just football fields (indoor floors, stages)
- Updating marcher's coordinates on the canvas is so much easier
  - Static functions in the `CanvasMarcher` class

### Goals accomplished this month

Must haves -

- [ ] Complete unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests for most things
- [x] Class based objects. Less interfaces in inappropriate spots

Nice to haves (basically the same from last month) -

- [x] Complete animation features (kind of)
- [x] Show marchers from prev page
- [x] Show pathways to prev page
- [ ] Snap to yard line or hash
- [ ] Find a better default location for marchers?
- [ ] Evenly distribute marchers function

### Plans for April

My priorities change for this every week. I really need to build integration tests, yet I still have not built a single one. Constant procrastination.

Must haves -

- Complete unit tests (still)
- Integration tests for most things (still)
  - Especially interacting with the canvas
- Batch alignment
  - Distribute evenly vertically and horizontally
  - Align vertically and horizontally
  - Snap to yard line

Nice to haves (basically the same from last month) -

- Find a better default location for marchers?
- Start shape creation?
- Music??
