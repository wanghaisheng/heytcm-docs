### What's changed?

A bunch of alignment features, page naming is error-proof, and music integration has started.

#### New UI Features

- Align marchers vertically and horizontally
- Evenly distribute marchers vertically and horizontally

#### Development Improvements

- Page naming got an absolute overhaul. That shouldn't have taken as long as it did, but hopefully it's done and I never need to touch it again. (famous last words)
- Created a "measure" class.
  - Trying to figure out how this will integrate with pages.
  - Will pages need measures? Are they optional?
  - What about for shows that don't have sheet music? (like indoor guard?)

### Goals accomplished this month

Must haves -

- [x] Complete unit tests
  - Like 90%. All new classes get unit tests to accompany them now.
- [ ] Integration tests for most things
  - This will be so time consuming and I'm waiting for a bit to do it.
- [x] Batch alignment

Nice to haves -

- [ ] Find a better default location for marchers?
- [ ] Start shape creation?
- [x] Music??
  - Started, thought this was much more important for a minimum product.

### Plans for May

I find that developing OpenMarch is also a game of me staying motivated. OpenMarch only makes progress when I'm enjoying doing it, which is most of the time luckily. I still get constant decision paralysis when making new features cause I try to plan for every possible use case. I need to keep it simple at this stage or I'm never going to get anything done.

Must haves -

- Finish music implementation with MusicXMLs
  - From sheet music, and then a generated wav file accompanying it
- Workflow for creating pages with MusicXML or just raw

Nice to haves -

- Create pages just on an audio file with no MusicXML
- Organize buttons in the UI
- Misc bugs (lots of old issues that need to be addressed)

Remember, you can always check the [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexDumo/OpenMarch) project to see what current issues are in the queue.
